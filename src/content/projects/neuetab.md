### Chrome NeueTab

This extension replaces your new tab page with a Helvetica Neue-inspired dashboard that makes it effortless to keep up-to-date with your stocks and the weather. Built with Angular.js, Browserify, and Gulp.

#### Sidebar

The app meant to be viewed passively, so the UI for configuration is in a pull-out sidebar.
