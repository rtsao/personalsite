### WebGL Polyhedral Symmetry Painting

This app demonstrates the symmetry groups of various polyhedra, more specifically, the Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, and icosahedron. It allows the user to generate paintings on a sphere that share the same rotational and/or mirror symmetries of a given symmetry group.
